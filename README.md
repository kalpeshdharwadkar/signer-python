The **Signer** class is designed for those who are signing data on behalf of a public-private keypair.

In principle, the "client party" has public key (i.e., `client_id`) and a matching private key (i.e., `client_secret`) that can be verified by both the signer and the client (but nobody else as we don't want to make forgeries possible).

The "signing party" has a simple identifier which acts as an additional piece of entropy in the algorithm, and can help differentiate between multiple signing parties if the client party does something like try to use the same public-private keypair independently of a signing party (as is common with GPG signing).

Based on a simplified version of the AWS Signature v4.

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) for managing backwards-compatibility.

> **NOTE:** To use this gem alongside the `wepay` gem, the `wepay` gem MUST be at least version `0.2.0`.

## Examples

(Using [word_wrap()](https://gist.github.com/js-coder/3581285) for line wrapping.)

```ruby
client_id = 'your_client_id'
client_secret = 'your_client_secret'

signer = WePay::Signer.new(client_id, client_secret)
signature = signer.sign({
  :token        => your_token,
  :page         => wepay_page_to_visit,
  :redirect_uri => partner_page_to_return_to,
})

puts signature.word_wrap(64)
#=> dfbffab5b6f7156402da8147886bba3eba67bd5baf2e780ba9d39e8437db7c47
#=> 35e9a0b834aa21ac76f98da8c52a2a0cd1b0192d0f0df5c98e3848b1b2e1a037

querystring = signer.generate_query_string_params({
  :token        => your_token,
  :page         => wepay_page_to_visit,
  :redirect_uri => partner_page_to_return_to,
})

#=> client_id=your_client_id&
#=> page=https://wepay.com/account/12345&
#=> redirect_uri=https://partnersite.com/home&
#=> token=dfbffab5b6f7156402da8147886bba3eba67bd5baf2e780ba9d39e8437db7c47...
```

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'wepay-signer'
```

And include it in your scripts:

```ruby
require 'wepay-signer'
```


## Testing

Firstly, run `bundle install` to download and install the dependencies.

You can run the tests as follows:

```bash
make test
```


## API Reference

The API Reference is generated by a tool called [YARD](http://yardoc.org). Once it's installed, you can generate
updated documentation by running the following command in the root of the repository.

```bash
make docs
```


## Deploying

1. The `Makefile` (yes, `Makefile`) has a series of commands to simplify the development and deployment process.
1. Also install [Chag](https://github.com/mtdowling/chag). This is used for managing the CHANGELOG and annotating the Git release correctly.

### Updating the CHANGELOG

Make sure that the CHANGELOG.md is human-friendly. See http://keepachangelog.com if you don’t know how.

### `make`

Running `make` by itself will show you a list of available sub-commands.

```bash
$ make
all
docs
gem
install
pushdocs
pushgem
tag
test
version
```

### `make pushdocs`
You will need to have write-access to the `wepay/signer-ruby` repository on GitHub. You should have already set up:

* Your SSH key with your GitHub account.
* Had your GitHub user given write-access to the repository.

Then you can run:

```bash
make pushdocs
```

You can view your changes at <https://wepay.github.io/signer-ruby/>.

### `make pushgem`
You will need to have pulled-down the proper gem credentials first. When prompted, enter your
[RubyGems](http://rubygems.org) password.

Login and view your [RubyGems profile page](https://rubygems.org/profile/edit) to see the proper command.

Then you can run:

```bash
make pushgem
```

If you need to [add an additional gem owner](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8487218/how-to-add-more-owners-to-a-gem-in-rubygem):

```bash
gem owner wepay -a api@wepay.com
```

You can view your changes at <https://rubygems.org/gems/wepay-signer>.

### `make tag`

This will leverage Chag to generate a commit for the tag. Then you can run:

```bash
make tag
```

### Drafting a GitHub release

1. Go to https://github.com/wepay/signer-ruby/tags
1. Find the new tag that you just pushed. Click the ellipsis (`…`) to see the commit notes. Copy these.
1. To the right, choose _Add release notes_. Your _Tag version_ should be pre-filled.
1. The _Release title_ should match your _Tag version_.
1. Inside _Describe this release_, paste the notes that you copied on the previous page.
1. Choose _Publish release_.
1. Your release should now be the latest. https://github.com/wepay/signer-ruby/releases/latest


## Contributing
Here's the process for contributing:

1. Fork Signer to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your GitHub copy of the repository into your local workspace.
3. Write code, fix bugs, and add tests with 100% code coverage.
4. Commit your changes to your local workspace and push them up to your GitHub copy.
5. You submit a GitHub pull request with a description of what the change is.
6. The contribution is reviewed. Maybe there will be some banter back-and-forth in the comments.
7. If all goes well, your pull request will be accepted and your changes are merged in.
